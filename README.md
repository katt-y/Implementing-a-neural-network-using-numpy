# Implementing-a-neural-network-using-numpy
A multi-layered neural network created  using only numpy 
The neural network is implemented on the SVHN dataset for digit classification. It has one hidden layer. Such hyperparameters can be tuned by changing the parameters of the function Neural network and those of the implemented optimizers. Two optimizers have been implemented - RMSProp and SGD.
